Hi! 👋

I'm a passionate security professional with over 8 years of experience spanning banking, insurance, and energy sectors.

## My Journey 🚀

My professional path has taken me across diverse industries, from investment banking to developing innovative solutions for major European organizations. My journey began with a first master's degree in Environmental Science, followed by a second master's degree in Computer Science. 

Starting as a GRC consultant to dive into cybersecurity, I quickly realized my passion for both the technical and strategic aspects of security. I completed various missions ranging from technical to strategic Security Consulting to consolidate my skills in risk assessment, compliance, Application Security, and recently in Cloud Security Architecture, working with prestigious organizations including Crédit Agricole CIB, AXA, VINCI, and energy companies like EDF. 

This unique blend of academic rigor and industry experience has shaped my approach to think outside the box and stay as close as possible to the best security practices.
